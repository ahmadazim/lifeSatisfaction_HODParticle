Somewhat dissatisfied,"I'm on campus, and the on campus atmosphere is a recipe for poor mental health and general unhappiness. We are discouraged from socializing, the dining halls are not open (and, frankly, are serving a narrow variety of food which it has become challenging to palate). I feel like I'm treated as a child, constantly reminded to follow rules I am already following. It does not feel like Harvard has any real concern for its students or is even trying to provide the same quality of education as they were pre-COVID. We were told that online classes would be ""better,"" and instead we have an increased workload and no excuses for decreased performance, even though we have been removed from the communal environment required to perform at such a high academic level, are isolated from friends and any socialization, and have to learn all course material through the barrier of a screen. Last week, my laptop screen time alone was over sixty hours -- I do not do entertainment of any kind on my laptop, only work. That kind of screen time is ridiculous.  ","1. Open dining halls, to allow for indoor, socially distanced socialization. It will be impossible to meet and hang out outside in February when it's 20 degrees and snowing, and especially those who live alone will struggle to socialize at all. 
2. Open study spaces, so students don't spend all of their waking hours beside besides whatever time they set aside for themselves to exercise or walk outside in their dorm room. 
3. Reduce hours on zoom, and encourage professors to modify workload to suit the current situation. Online school simply cannot expect the same level of performance as real school, and the number of hours on zoom we are expected to spend is excessive. 
4. As always, more transparency. How is it that it is nearly November and I do not yet know how long of a winter break I need to be planning for?

Somewhat satisfied,"While being on campus is nice and allows first years to have a community with each other, there is not nearly enough social support from Harvard. I certainly appreciate being able to reserve individiual study spaces and reach out to friends, but especially as the months get colder, I'm worried that there will be no spaces available (outside or inside) to meet up with friends and get the social interactions that I need. This also makes it more likely that people on campus may break rules to be inside with friends, which would risk undermining the low case count we've had so far. Also, there is no framework for social interaction that was promised before (i'm not sure what the college events board has organized that have been meaningful for in person interactions in small groups)... and I find that the class of 2024 is increasingly becoming self segregated, especially along racial lines. I worry about the social impact of virtual classes, and I think while Harvard has done a great job keeping campus safe, they need to focus more on making campus life meaningful and worthwhile.","1. Create more common spaces inside that are safe and allow interactions between small groups. Based on my experience with the science & engineering for managing covid freshman seminar, I think this does not introduce a substantially higher risk compared to opening the MAC/ Smith center/ etc. given there are filters, ventilation, and masks provided. Furthermore, I also think this will prevent the inevitable violations of common room/ dorm guidelines for gathering friends during winter.

2. Create more social support frameworks and ways to facilitate meeting new people -- I think this should've been in place from the beginning of Fall semester, but it would still be really nice to be paired with a ""buddy"" or cohort for support (preferrably people from outside your entryway/dorm).

1. The first year of college is the most important and formative year. Being on campus as a first year, I've realized just how much value there is in terms of the social support, friends, and mental health, not to mention being able to easily adjust to classes and even meet up with some professors. Sending first years home after first semester threatens to undo all of the progress, social relationships, academic and athletic success, mental and physical health, and campus life/skills that we have developed here. I'm especially worried that the relationships I have built up for fall semester in person will fizzle out without interaction in the spring and I will have to start again from scratch whenever I return to campus.
2. First years have experience living on campus and have done a good job so far of keeping COVID cases down and compliance with regulations high. They also don't have many other alternatives that are open to them -- while sophomores and juniors can more easily find apartments or other living options together with the friends they already have (some are doing so and have signed longer leases), first years would face a lot of challenges in doing the same without financial, social, and institutional support.

Somewhat satisfied,"I think generally the courses have been planned for remote learning as expected. But I feel like it might be harder to connect with people than usual. Besides, there're still many events that are happening at crazy times for international students.","I think it's rather important that Harvard can consider more for the international students. For example, I heard another international student said Harvard only gives I20 at the end of spring semester and you can get your visa over the summer and go to campus only in the fall. I'm not completely sure whether it's true, but if it's true, it'd be important to urge Harvard to change that so that international students who are not able to go to campus this fall can go to campus in the spring. Further, even if we get the visa, if first-year students are not allowed to go to campus in the spring (I guess Harvard planned to only allow seniors in the spring), we still can't. But I think Harvard should allow freshmen, at least international ones, to go to campus in the Spring. Otherwise, most international students will spend their whole first year off campus, which is both unfair and a loss of a lot of fantastic experience. Moreover, I heard that Harvard is gradually opening its libraries and some public spaces. It'd be obviously unfair for students not able to go to campus to enjoy these opportunities, especially when Harvard is charging the same amount of tuition and fees for students on and off campus.

(For example, Physics 16 is doing a good job since it is having one session in the morning and one in the afternoon, so students all over the globe can attend.)

Very dissatisfied,"It seems to me that there were not sufficient effort and considerations put, on the part of faculty, into designing their online courses in ways that adhere to Harvard's educational standards. Two of my courses are basically made up of slides with professors reading from them. Even though the courses are administered remotely, I believe there is room to add a more interactive component to them. For example, CS50 streams its lectures live on stage. I took CS50 in-person last fall, and I have taken the time to watch one of their lectures this year - it is pretty close to the real experience, when it gets to the mental engagement with the lecturer. I have also taken online courses on EdX - ones that were recorded in real classrooms- and my experience in those is much better than mine with this fall's classes! 

Another aspect that is very upsetting is the disadvantaged position that many international students are put in when it comes to equal resources.

Somewhat dissatisfied,"I was quadded as a freshman and was put in a single. On top of that, the other people on my floor were not in my entryway. The first month here was really really difficult. There was little support for freshman. One small example is that no one showed us where the trash or recycling was, and the house held a ""welcome"" zoom call which I thought would explain things like that but really it just talked about COVID... again. There is no reason I should be alone in the quad especially since I requested 4 roommates on my housing application. Also, a lot of the things that are open - restaurants, the MAC, study spaces - are far away from the quad and therefore unreachable with zoom calls being at random times throughout the day.  ","There is NO reason freshman should be in the quad. With the lack of support for us here, I'm worried that with less freshman on campus the ones who are quadded will be even worse off. It would also be nice to allow people in the quad to eat at a dining hall near the yard (doesn't have to be Annenberg) because if I spend more than 3 hours away from my dorm I either have to buy food or take a 30 minute detour to go back to the quad.

Also, I don't understand why Harvard's COVID socializing policy didn't apply to freshman and their proctors and PAFs. We couldn't meet with them in person until this past week, and to me it seems too late to get to know them and our entryway. There should also be a tuition decrease, and ESPECIALLY a room and board reduction.

Being on campus, right now at least, is arguably simply meant for people to be able to socialize and connect and the freshman needed that because they needed to be able to meet people, so they got that, in a modified form, but they still got time on campus. Thus, they should not be prioritized or even in the running for being on-campus in the Spring if we are choosing based on fairness. I will even say I have asked a freshman in one of my classes right now and he said he believes that reasoning is fair.

If we are assuming the seniors (and everyone who needs to be) are already coming back, then that leaves the sophomore and juniors. If we think about the total amount of time each cohort of Harvard students has had on campus so far, the sophomores have had one semester and a half and the juniors have had three and a half semesters, and the seniors have had five and a half. I understand why the seniors should be prioritized and that has already been established. I think that purely looking at time spent on campus, sophomores should be the next cohort to be brought back after the seniors. I know there is an argument to be made that if we go back to ""normal"" by Fall 2021, the juniors and sophomores will have lost the same amount of time, but we don't have the luxury of making that assumption at the moment. Plus, the current juniors will be seniors in the Fall 2021 which would mean that they would likely be given priority of being on campus next year if we still face this challenge then.

There also have been unspoken rules about students not being allowed into the courtyards of other houses, which makes students spending time together (in order to not lose their minds) more difficult.

Somewhat satisfied,"I'm a current first-year living on campus and things have been better than I've thought. They opened the MAC, Smith Student Center, and Cabot Science Library a few weeks ago. So, it's been nice to use those spaces and get out of my dorm room. But, I'm disappointed that they won't open Widener Library for study or allow us to eat together in Annenberg. I understand the need for social distancing and not having large groups gather, but I think there are methods for small numbers of people to eat in Annenberg or study in Widener. Also, I think the current reservation system for Smith and Cabot Library could be improved. As of right now, you can only reserve one spot each day (for equity reasons) but every time I study at either Smith or Cabot there are so many open seats. I think students should be allowed to reserve two time slots for either Cabot or Smith.","As mentioned in the previous section, I would open more spaces like Annenberg, Widener, and Lamont.

There should be a plan in place for regulations and rules to be loosened should the campus meet a certain standard of covid regulation.

Very dissatisfied,"I am extremely dissatisfied with how Harvard has handled the situation. Harvard has the most resources and largest endowment in the entire world, yet we are one of the only schools in the country that has not figured out how to reopen the campus safely to everyone.

I am missing out my college experience, but also paying full tuition for an experience that is less than 10% of what I would be experiencing on campus. Why hasn't the administration reached out to ask for feedback from the students on this semester so far? I have had no contact from administration where I can share my thoughts on how students online are being overworked and stressed even more so than usual. The no-reply email ""check ins"" from administration do nothing, where paragraphs and paragraphs of the same idea are repeated, saying that they tried and were successful even though all of the students feel otherwise.  Harvard needs to do better, and use their enormous vault of resources to actually try and help their students by bringing them back like every single other school in this country.  ","Of course adjustments need to be made.  How can every other school in the country manage to bring their students back safely, yet Harvard has made no effort to even try.  If they had tried, we would be back on campus spread out, using the graduate school housing that is no longer used, using safe measures so that we can have as much of our college experience. But Harvard will only bring back the classes that have priority.  However, with the way Harvard is making their choices, sophomores will be left with only 2.75 years or less of time on campus.

Somewhat satisfied,Classes all have way more hours of meetings and more work than the usual semester. FAS needs to send a message to all courses telling them to tone it down!! Four classes is a lot at once and professors need to make sure that their classes are more forgiving than usual right now.,"I think the general structure is fine--however, the spring semester has the benefit of spring break in the middle of it. If they do this idea of splitting up spring break, it will be as if we have NO BREAK AT ALL!!! I am in very strong opposition to the plan of splitting up spring break. From my perspective, one day off is not really a break--just because there is one day off, professors will still assign the same amount of homework for the week, and sometimes even assign extra work because they know we have extra time to do it! We might have a few days with no class, but we will have a full EXTRA week's worth of problem sets and readings, because we won't have spring break, and will instead be going straight through the semester with no week off of real work. If FAS wants to go through with this plan, they need to do a lot more thinking about how they are going to ENFORCE preventing professors from assigning work over the days of the break. In my experience, professors will simply take advantage of this plan as a way to assign more work, leading to students getting LESS of a break, at the detriment of our health.",5 or 6 days per week,One or 2 days a week,One or 2 days a week,Never,Never,Never,Never,3 or 4 days a week,At least once a month,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,At least once a month,At least once a month,I don't like going to extra events on zoom.

It will literally be as if there is no break at all!! Don't cancel our precious break!! There are so many things that take more than one day off to do!!

Somewhat satisfied,"I appreciate that Harvard's policies have led to such a low case rate among undergrads. I think they have failed to adequately provide for the needs of first years in two places. First, because they have not provided any opportunities for in person socializing, people have been forced into two choices. Either you remain alone in your room, hoping that one day interactions over zoom will make you feel something, or you circumvent the rules because in person interaction is really important for mental health. Fortunately, because of Harvard's strong policies, interactions among students are actually very safe. 
Second, as the days have gotten colder, they should have provided indoor spaces in which small groups of students can gather. I say this because I have a study group of three other students, and we have been suffering through the cold to be able to meet up in person. Last weekend it was too much, so we moved to facetime. Facetime is not as effective, but it's that or be forced to sit in 30 degree weather for an hour and a half. Again, because Harvard's policies have been so effective at containing undergrad cases, it would be conceivably safe to allow us to sit together inside, masked up, so we don't fail our classes.","Yes. Once everyone has been on campus for a month (which I think is about the time it took for me to feel sure that no undergrad I was interacting with had covid), they should allow for small groups to meet inside.

Somewhat dissatisfied,"I’m thankful that freshman had the opportunity to come back to campus because I personally was in a not-so-good home situation and i needed to not be there anymore, but I definitely feel like my mental health took a big decline being here. Harvard’s fall reopening plan was so isolating. I understand the strictness when we all first go onto campus because you know we didn’t know who was Covid positive who was Covid negative we didn’t know how the spread would work and I totally understand not wanting our cases to go up. However, the freshmen have proven over and over and over again that we are able to live on this campus without contributing to the number of Covid cases. We have gone three or four or maybe five weeks without a single Covid case, as well as we’ve seen an increase in crimson clear users, and things are just going really well. So why is Harvard still being so strict and isolating with their reopening? It was snowing the other day and raining the entire week before that and it was gloomy and you couldn’t go outside and it’s hard seasonal depression wise Covid depression wise it’s hard to be alone in your room for days on end because you can’t go outside. And I am lucky enough to have a roommate but what about the people in singles that I have to stay inside alone in the room for days on end? There should be no reason why common rooms can’t be open or more interaction in the library like study groups in the library can’t happen, not when the freshman class has proven that we can be safe while doing that. Also I do think people should be allowed in other people’s rooms. I’m definitely not condoning dorm parties or anything like that but I do not see an issue where my friend and I need to study for a test and she comes over to my dorm and we can study together or I’m having a bad day and I go to my friend for advice and we want to be in a location where we can have an open conversation or something along those lines especially with the snow and the cold in the rain and then not being able to be outside. I just feel like Harvard did a lot of things right with their reopening but they did a lot a lot of things wrong and it’s only gonna get gloomy here in the spring, it’s only gonna get colder in the spring, and I don’t want to see peoples mental health go down further than it already has. ","In the first few weeks that we came onto campus I totally understood the strictness and I would probably keep that the same for the first week or two. But I feel like as the on-campus residents start to prove that they can in fact be on this campus without contributing to the spread of COVID-19, I feel like Harvard should become more lenient and less isolating. We are all testing negative so why cannot we go play air hockey in the common room or why can’t we go watch a movie in another person’s dorm or why can’t we have small social gatherings outside so that we can meet people? I don’t think Harvard realizes how many people don’t have friends how many people don’t have a single support system on campus and that is dangerous for mental health. The best thing about Harvard is the community and I feel like there is no community and Harvard really needs to help facilitate that. And again the freshman class has proven that we can be on this campus without contributing to the spread of COVID-19 and I feel like we deserve a little lenience for that.

I get migraines being on the computer every day, my laser eye surgery that I got not too long ago is starting to reverse itself because of how much we’re staring at the screens. I feel so disconnected from Harvard because I just can’t stand to be in the computer any longer. And I would like to reiterate that I still don’t understand why we can’t have more social interactions when we’ve all tested negative for weeks consecutively.

I wish you could see my room right now because it’s an Actual disaster but I just don’t have the time to clean it because of how much time I spend on the computer just trying to finish all my work and time and I still can never get it all done.

We suddenly have mandatory to our sections every week on top of the three hour lecture that we already have we suddenly have more pieces than ever before we suddenly have a lab that we’ve never had before that we have this semester. We only get 10 minutes of office hours at a time. And we don’t get holidays off so we still have to attend class during Labor Day and indigenous peoples day. This is ridiculous and I cannot believe Harvard allowed CS50 to do this. The math department doesn’t even teach anymore. It’s hard enough to never see our actual professor but then we have TFs and that should be fine, right, because they are highly qualified to teach our subject, right? No because we don’t even have our TFs. They spend maybe 10 or 15 minutes talking to us and then were sent into breakout rooms to just work independently with our peers. Which sounds fine if we actually knew what we were doing but because we don’t get the proper instruction and because they didn’t take into account the fact that we all have different levels of experience we sit in a breakout room for an hour an hour plus not knowing what to do with not having the assistance to do what we need to do. So in essence we are paying $70,000 to come to the school not to learn from a professor not to learn from a TS but to teach ourselves how to do everything. On top of this we also have required lectures every other day on top of required section meetings on top of required a synchronous lectures on top of required PSETs on top of required group projects. I mean it’s ridiculous that for every single class that we have we have 10 times more work now than ever before when things are 10 times harder now than ever before. And I can’t for the life of me understand why so many schools in this country are adopting pass fail policies for the semester and for remote learning but Harvard is in allowing pass fail classes. Harvard isn’t even allowing students to withdraw from classes. I tried to withdraw for my math class because I genuinely I genuinely can’t do it I just can’t do it anymore and my resident dean told me that I couldn’t withdraw because I didn’t have an extraordinary or extenuating circumstance as if the pandemic was not extraordinary or extenuating enough.

At the very least, they should take the same number of people that they had in the fall, but I believe this is a sign that they can successfully manage a greater cohort. Yale, which is very similar to Harvard, brought back 60% of their students; while they have had more cases, it has been nowhere near the sort of outbreaks that have been happening at big state schools. For this reason, with Harvard's testing and quarranting capacity I believe the university could safely bring back 50% of their student body, perhaps even 70%.

In terms of sophomores vs. juniors, I believe juniors should get priority due to the necessity of beginning larger scale research/thesis work and the resources that only being on campus can provide. Additionally, juniors are more likely to be friends with seniors, making this their last chance to spend time with members of the class of 2021 who are graduating. But realistically, there is not a huge difference between juniors and sophomores and I would understand either decision.

First-years should be the lowest on the priority list given that they were here in the fall.

The only reason I do go is because they grade our in class exercises AND post-class quizzes. Mind you, this is for a class that meets 3x a week. Is that not a lot to ask of a student? We hardly ever finish the exercises in class and we need to spend time outside of class finishing them. We also have psets to work on. This terrible class I am referring to is CS109a. Please tell the instructors the cut it out. This is just one class. We are taking at least three others. It's just ridiculous. Another grievance of mine is that professors state that they have a lot going on and to excuse them for errors but they aren't offering the same leniency to students. In Stat139, Kevin had been promising to release the grades of our second pset for three weeks. He finally released them after we submitted out midterm three weeks later. How is that at all useful for students? We need to get our grades back so that we can see whether we have any conceptual misunderstanding of a subject and whether our work is correct so we can apply that in future assignments. When asked about it he just said ""oh there's been a lot going on."" I'm sure that is true! But if the professors are allowed to procrastinate things then students should be too. There needs to be more late days offered in classes. One of my classes (CS171) offers 2 late days. If you do take a late day though then that's automatically 10% off your grade. What kind of a late day is that?? You are being penalized for submitting an assignment one day late anyway so how is that taking a late day? They need to get off their high horse and realize that the world is different and they cannot play by previous rules. Seriously, make the professors take a course on kindness and empathy. Seems like they forget that. 

I'm glad y'all mentioned the tuition fees. Another thing that makes NO sense to me is that Harvard increased tuition this semester. Everything is remote. I do not see a single professor or classmate in person. I have Zoom issues and I am not learning half as well as I would be on campus. And they raised the tuition?? Are they insane? Please justify this action.The tuition should be on par with the extension school or at least lessened. Not raised wtf.

The grading policy needs to be lightened. Professors can't have the standard cut off of 90+ means an A etc. I think they need to be more lenient in terms of grading.

Somewhat dissatisfied,"I'm very happy that not many undergraduates have contacted the virus. However, Harvard's support for students at home in challenging situations has been so awful. The University overall has been incredibly rigid and functioning ""business as usual"" which creates so much unnecessary stress and an unequitable playing field at a time where the University publicly professes being committed to things like justice and caring for students. Students on campus also have such rigid rules that their well beings are at stake, and the idea of having select students and administrators monitoring students sounds very anxiety provoking and like it could unequally produce higher surveillance of certain groups without much transparency. ","Yes, Harvard should change to pass/fail grading, prioritize students mental health, and do much much more to support students struggling at home. Harvard literally has offered barely any financial support to someone who needs technology, a hot spot, or wifi. Instead, they have told students, some who are even on full financial aid, to get a loan if they can't cover all of their expenses for a necessity. Some students families are seriously struggling to pay for food and increased bills due to the cost of their kids being at home. Harvard has barely done anything to make innovative ways to use our resources to equitably help students in all the ways asked for in our original petition. Instead the university has silenced our needs. It is heartbreaking and makes me not want to give a penny to this uncaring institution when I graduate.

Instructors have also made no changes to their regular reading load or assignment amounts but students are struggling. This is not a typical semester! Professors should adjust their priorities. All of my classes have had to offer students continual extensions. I'm a CA for a class that has multiple students turn in their papers late. Students are not lazy, we need more support! It is cruel to expect us to be business as usual in a pandemic that has literally changed the priorities of the whole country. The university needs to assist to best suit our needs. The ironic thing is, if the University actually made more equity in grading, supported students in challenging environments, and made sure the workload was properly adjusted for our more limited capacities (many professors are more limited too!) we would actually learn better! ",1,2,3,4,5,,1,4,2,3,,1,2,3,,Definitely will not,It is literally not an option financially,Very dissatisfied,"Tuition reduction, increased remote learning budget, adding an off campus living budget like Princeton, adding a budget for course books-- I've struggled to get so many books, increased remote job opportunities, increased technology budget and did budget for students facing food insecurity and on full financial aid who cannot go back to campus. It is cruel that the LEQ asks about our situations and then offers no supports! It's a sign that Harvard is willing to document our suffering just to write articles and say that they asked but they are not willing to do the work to adequately support us all behind closed doors. Also the financial aid office has been incredibly lacking in transparency and incredibly unavailable to reach. For students being to independently petition for more funds, the process was very long, frustrating, misleading, and not offered to all students. Some students were even told this option did not exist. ",,"1, the University should make it very clear that the LEQ is a petition for going back to campus. They should also separate the LEQ from general support for students. When I filled out the LEQ, I didn't even know it was a petition to go back to campus and this was so misleading. I thought the University was trying to figure out what ways they could support students in a variety of situations and rather than offering any supports, they either invited you back to campus or not. I honestly don't have enough words for how incredibly disheartening it was to see the University approach the so- called ""learning environment questionnaire"" this way. The University seriously needs to maintain its commitment to students off campus. This is a deadly virus, some of us literally have health conditions that make us at higher risk at school. We should not be punished just because we can't go back to school. Harvard's resources and supports should extend to us wherever we are as the University promised it would support our right to learn at Harvard when we were admitted. ",Yes (please elaborate below),"It should be increased. The flat rate of $5,000 that was non negotiable didn't take into account all of our expenses or the fact that for some students to have minimally sufficient learning environments, this requires moving out of their house into a temporary apartment. Other schools like Princeton have acknowledged that students may be needing to live in apartments right now and added more supports. The $5000 didn't cover the costs for my apartment, which I needed because my house is an unsafe environment. I had another friend who desperately needed more support from Harvard and had to get it from their scholarship fund because Harvard refused to be flexible to their situation (and they are on full financial aid). Its so discouraging seeing how many students can naturally afford to go move to another city to live with friends or live off campus and to know that Harvard is unwilling to give any more sport for people on financial aid so we can make sure we have a proper learning environment as well. To have grades while our learning environments are so unequal and Harvard is unwilling to equalize them for them to even be minimally sufficient for everyone is not enough. It's just truly sad and beyond disappointing.

Somewhat satisfied,"The 7 day average positivity rate is quite low and students are able to remain safe. However, it seems like other schools who opted for a hybrid system of bringing back students also did well, even in the Boston area. For example, Northeastern’s NUflex hybrid program has an incredibly low rate of positive cases as well, with 5000 students being tested a day. This program let students stay at home if they wanted while opening up the opportunity for students to stay on campus or near it and go to classes if they wanted to. Students had to adhere to strict rules with violations being strictly punished, but, this likely led to increased safety on campus. The cost of the testing and restrictions is likely in the millions (assuming $25 per test times 5000=$125,000 per day in testing alone) but it has allowed many students to have an enjoyable and safe experience while also not forcing students to come back if they choose not to.","I would appreciate if Harvard could look at other schools like northeastern and determine if they are able to allow for some increased flexibility or capacity of students on campus. Many students are suffering greatly from being away, and it seems that there are avenues to bring more of them back safely. Additionally, the online learning experience is by and large a significantly worse experience even for some of the better transitioned classes. I hope Harvard understands that stimulation online is many magnitudes lower than what it is in a dynamic in person class.

My grandfather became severely ill and so I became his full time caretaker which also made it much harder to attend classes synchronously.

Somewhat dissatisfied,"Don't get me wrong- my professors have done an amazing job at converting their classes to an online format. I think that I may be even learning more and all of my professors have been super understanding of the situation. I am mostly dissatisfied with how Harvard handled individual's financial situations. The financial aid this semester was very strict and I feel that Harvard was not super inclusive on considering people's situations. By offering $5000 to people on financial aid who chose to not live on campus, Harvard set up a situation where students had to choose between a stable learning environment and supporting their families. Even though I figured it out, I was also in a much mor fortunate situation this semester than others. It still irks me months later that they put so many of their students in that situation.","I think that financial aid should be more flexible in order to accommodate each individual's situation. We are all facing a variety of different challenges with this situation, and given that Harvard has the resources and is supposed to be committed to assisting their students in every facet of their education, they should be more accommodating to these unique circumstances. I have also heard through the grapevine that administration is thinking of having freshman on campus in the spring. I'm a sophomore, so I have accepted the fact that my class won't be on campus this year, but I do think that it is unfair to not allow the juniors to be on campus with the seniors, especially since the freshman were allowed on campus this semester.",Every day,Never,One or 2 days a week,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,3 or 4 days a week,Never,Never,3 or 4 days a week,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,Never,,65,15,4,10,2,1,,5,7,3,3,5,4,5,5,7,0,5,5,5,5,10,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,0,5,,"Difficulty focusing or paying attention to online instruction or activities,Personal preference for face-to-face learning,Course lessons or activities that haven't translated well to an online environment",,,5,4,3,2,1,"Obviously, if it is safe to do so (Harvard keeps frequently testing and people follow guidelines), then I would prefer that everyone was back on campus, even if classes are still online.

I think it also will be influenced on what Harvard's financial aid decision is in the spring.,Somewhat dissatisfied,"I feel that Harvard's financial aid policies haven't adapted to fit the individual challenges that we are all facing right now. As a first-generation, low-income student, I was put between a rock and a hard place when they announced that if I didn't live on campus, I would get $5000 to support my family and if I did, I wouldn't get that. I think Harvard forgets that members of the FGLI community have been fighting to support their families their whole lives, and that that isn't going to change just because they are in college now. ","I think that Virtual Shopping week should be like normal shopping week. The class previews before the start of the semester didn't accomodate the fact that no one had planned to have to go to classes until September, so many people had to work because their summer internships/jobs hadn't ended. I think having shopping week outside of the weeks of school creates many limitations for people to attend.","I think that making people recount their negative experiences in order to beg for a stable place to live is very insensitive.

Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"'- There is a serious lack of consideration for the mental wellbeing of students - especially for those who return to campus. 

- Harvard needs to expand the number of classes they welcome back to campus.
","Harvard has slowly allowed the reopening of campus spaces at the end of this semester. I believe that this should be done earlier on in the Spring semester if there are no outbreaks or concerning changes in the covid situation. I think so long as there are restrictions around the reopening of common spaces, there should not be a problem with opening house common spaces early on next semester, limiting only a few or handful of students in at a time. I think this is incredibly important for students who are living in singles and otherwise have no in person contact with others unless meeting them outside, which becomes increasingly difficult with the colder weather.

Going into next semester, I hope that Harvard acknowledges the limited number of covid cases on campus this semester and considers bringing back two classes as opposed to just one. In addition to seniors, Harvard should consider allowing juniors to return to campus. It seems as though there is capacity to bring both of these classes back, as well as those who may need to petition to return. I think this will be an important move for many students, whom are more successful academically on campus but may not otherwise petition to return if they are not invited back.

There needs to be more online and outdoor social programming.
