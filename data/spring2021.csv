Return to how it was pre-covid.,Yes,Extremely dissatisfied,"I came to harvard for the people primarily. I have met 0 people in the last 13 months. I have made no new friends. If anything, my existing friendships have deteriorated greatly. I have been alone because harvard did not invite my grade back to campus. One's satisfaction with their education waxes and wanes; I understand that. There were periods of up and down in high school, as well as pre-covid at Harvard my freshman year. But there was always the opportunity to meet new people, join a new club, or engage in fun activities and socializing. This year has been awful. While Covid has reduced everyone's experience, in higher education and beyond, I blame the College itself 95% for my awful year. Given that 1) covid rarely affects people my age in serious ways and 2) Harvard has tremendous resources to keep people safe, I feel that there is no excuse to not have had all four classes on campus, in both the fall and spring. What's more, the fall say a miniscule positive test rate! And this still did not motivate the planning committee to invite more than 2 grades back in the spring! The fall was billed as an experiment; it went great. And yet the spring plan barely reflected such a roaring success! The 2020-2021 academic year is a black eye that my fellow Sophomores and I will not soon forget. Our college's decision was as unsympathetic to the Sophomore experience as possible. There is no feasible way in which the decisions made for 2020-2021 could have been less generous to our grade. We were totally online-- in what additional ways could one have reduced our experience? Besides banning us from zoom -- which hardly would have changed my own happiness, considering zoom is a joke-- I can't think of any. 

I consider the treatment of the sophomores to be shameful. I have not a single positive thing to say about the planning of the 2020-2021 academic year. Never before has a ""virtual"" call been considered a social event in the vein of, say, going out to dinner with friends. Yet the planning committee considers it to be a near-equal mimic of in-person events-- it's not. 

The planning committee, with respect to its hesitancy to invite students on-campus and allow for fun to transpire rule-and-punishment free, has this year put on a master class in uncreative planning, cowardly decision-making, and dereliction of duty. It is a difficult thing to damper the excitement and cheer of 20-something-year old college students. But my congratulations to the people in charge of planning the 2020-2021 academic year: you have achieved what I thought impossible.

One note: I'm on the fence as to whether everyone should wear regalia or not. I think it'd be cool to do the walk into Tercentenary Theater with our houses, but wearing graduation gowns so long after graduation would feel odd/silly.

Professors like to trod all over it and aasign papers, homework, etc. willy nilly throughout this so-called ""break"". Spring break never felt like a break to me, just a semi-stressful time of no classes and lots of homework.

On the other hand, you have grumpier professors who do not understand the stress. ""What's the big deal? They have so much time. They sit at their computers all day anyway, in their comfy houses, wearing pyjamas."" This is the type of attitude that really hurts the culture of Harvard and the mental health of its students. The professor may grade as harshly (or MORE harshly) and assign students more work. It is actually a big problem.

Since sophomores have not been invited back on campus this entire academic year, I have been at home and struggling with motivation, focus, isolation, family issues, and so much more. It has been especially difficult this semester, since it's been over a year now that I have experienced an even semi-normal semester of classes. And with summer and fall plans still unannounced, I am very anxious that I'll be stuck home even longer and miss basically all of my Harvard experience.","Since I was hoping to be on campus this semester, I had to decide against petitioning so that I could get the $5,000 reimbursement to use for my family's needs like bills, groceries, etc. I know many FGLI students (especially the FGLI sophomores) have had to make similar tough decisions deciding between this money from Harvard and having a stable learning environment on campus. I wish Harvard would have not made FGLI students decide between these two, and still fully reimbursed low-income students living on campus. ",Sophomore,,,"First, of course, would be bringing us back to campus in Fall of 2021. I think there should be events specifically for sophomores since we really have missed out on a lot this year. Though my house has been really involved via Zoom (go Quincy!!)

Continuing their system now would be great, though I'm sure it will be much more intense and difficult with much more people back on campus. If we do get to a state where we can have small gatherings safely, I would love to see Harvard helping organize/fund these small events for community-bonding and much-needed socialization outside of the computer screen. I also think that Harvard should be much more strict on students who break the COVID 19 guidelines and safety rules since I know that was a huge issue in the fall semester and it seemed that nothing happened to those who were jeopardizing the health and housing of those around them.","NEVER CONSIDER CONTINUING WELLNESS DAYS.

The extent of my social life is calling my friends on Zoom once every 1-2 months, and though that's always great, it's nothing like getting every meal together like we used to pre-COVID. Especially since I live at home with just my one parent and do not leave my house due to the pandemic, I always feel very alone and isolated.","Honestly, I think it goes without saying that Harvard cannot fully return to a pre-COVID campus by this Fall. But despite this, I think Harvard needs to prioritize bringing more students back on campus rather than prioritizing in-person/hybrid classes. I think it is much more important to make sure everyone who wants to be on campus can be in the Fall so that we can begin to repair the social decline felt by all students, staff, and professors. Since this is already challenging in terms of maintaining public health and safety, I think having completely virtual classes but everyone being on campus is WAY preferred over having some people back on campus and them having hybrid/in-person classes availible.",,Might or might not,"I will definitely enroll if myself and my friends are able to live on campus, and I definitely might not enroll if we aren't able to.

I dread waking up in the morning because I know I will be forced to bask in the light of an overpriced Apple product for at least 12 hours every single day. Every hour of every day, since school started in September, has been numbingly consumed with school work, Zoom meetings, and sorting through numerous emails containing unsatisfactory gestures from the university to ""increase a sense of community during this virtual year."" However, this ""virtual year"" only applies to sophomores at the College. All other classes were invited back on campus, but the class of 2023 has been completely cast aside by the ""best"" University in the world, having been barred from any opportunity to return to campus this year. Furthermore, the University refuses to even acknowledge their complete disregard for the Class of 2023. 

When I enrolled at Harvard, I was expecting an experience filled with personal discovery and educational and intellectual exploration. Instead, I have been gifted with 12+ hours on a computer every day and, subsequently, depression and extreme burn-out with no support from the University. As a sophomore, nearly half of my ""Harvard experience"" will be through the screen of my computer, crammed in the corner of my bedroom. I used to love school; my first semester at Harvard was incredible and I loved every second of it. Now, I dread every single aspect of my ""education."" It is crushing when I see that my high school friends are able to interact with their peers and continue to have their transformative college experiences while I am stuck at home, counting down the days until this dreadful school year is over. I wish the University would have considered this, and similar experiences, when planning for the spring. 

In order to ""make up"" for this, the University apparently only sees one acceptable response: to allow those who stayed at home all year to enroll in two Harvard Summer School classes for ""free."" However, this opportunity is only free if one decides to take theses classes from... Yep, you guessed it! - HOME. With a $40+ billion endowment, this response from the University is utterly embarrassing. Further, these summer courses will also be entirely virtual. I think I can speak for the entire class of 2023 when I say that THE LAST THING any of us want to do is take MORE ONLINE CLASSES. But somehow, the University thinks this is an acceptable way to make up for months of depression, lack of support, no interaction with peers, and countless other detrimental side effects of being cast aside by the ""best university in the world.""

This was a good decision for my own health and for my family's health. It's really allowed me to focus a bit more on my wellness, and together as a family, it has really given us a lot of time to enjoy each other's company. However, the time zone difference made a lot of communications with the school (professors, advisors, etc.) much more difficult, so there were times when I felt lonely and a bit helpless. I have tried to attend more online social events, but sometimes, I refuse to attend these meetings because it's contributing greatly to my daily screen time (which can sometimes spike up to 12 hours). As a result of this, I sometimes suffer from eye strain, fatigue, and burn out. I know this is not ideal for anyone, but I understand that everyone is going through their own struggles, so I have really been appreciating all the kind words that the administration team has sent out to undergraduates. ","First of all, I would have really appreciated if Harvard announced their Spring plan earlier. The plan announcement time was really inconvenient for many of us who need to plan their trip, tickets, and all things that come with traveling. Second, it would have been EXTREMELY helpful if Spring Break still took place. Right now, I am feeling like I am always doing work, even on Wellness Days, which sort of defeats the purpose of Wellness Days. I am always on my screen, working on endless assignments, submitting endless projects and essays. There's really not a time for me to rejuvenate because I am always anxious about work and missing deadlines (especially with the online format, keeping track of dates becomes even harder). I have been feeling burnt out since the end of February, and all that's holding me together so far is the countdown until summer break. ",First-year,,,,"Online learning has definitely given me a taste of the rigors of Harvard's academics. I wouldn't say I am confident with the academics here because I think there's a huge part of the classroom experience that is lacking in my academic journey. However, I do have to acknowledge that some of my professors have really tried their best to make things interesting even with the Zoom format and to lighten up the Zoom room every once in a while.

I have heard that case rates on campus are low and therefore the administration is not as worried about policies such as allowing guests in one's rooms, but the massive increase in total area cases relative to last semester would make me, at the very least, more worried about letting so many people back on campus.

I have an 11 hour time difference (but currently 10 hours since daylight savings have resumed) which has been detrimental to my health owing to severe lack of sleep and a chaotic (and almost non-existent) schedule amidst a workload that would be ordinarily hard under normal conditions to begin with. I haven't been able to participate in much of the opportunities on offer (extracurricular or otherwise), and the handful I did manage to take (e.g. Harvard i-Labs) have sessions at ungodly hours in my time zone, making it more difficult for me to utilise such opportunities since they also do not record a majority of their events for internationals like myself to watch. Furthermore, though there are a few people of my nationality/place of origin who are undergraduates at the college, I am the only one from my country who is not a US resident and hence its harder (understandably) for my peers to empathize with my situation, not that the utter lack of socialization for me (owing to my current place of residence) is a primary concern of mine right now.","Recording ALL academic and extracurricular sessions and remove all need (at least for people a certain number of hours ahead/behind of EST) to attend synchronous sessions, so that we too are able to access the resources/opportunities Harvard has on offer without sacrificing essential needs such as sleep.

Surprising as this sounds, and by that I refer to making resources accessible; no use doing all these otherwise valuable and engaging events if I can't access them owing to no recordings being available for me to watch later. For the rest, can't do much myself if an institution like Harvard with all that it has can't resolve these issues even after a whole year online.

There is no excuse for the Fall 2021 semester to not be entirely in-person, with all grades on campus and all/most classes being in-person. I have spoken to so many people in my class about this, and there is no one that doesn't agree with this! Also, I would really hope that freshman pre-orientation programs (such as FIP) are in-person as well. It is impossible to overstate how important FIP is for incoming international students ‚Äì¬†they have already suffered too much because of not being properly integrated into Harvard, and not allowing future international students to be fully integrated into Harvard and the U.S by not having an in-person FIP would be extremely disappointing. 

Overall, Harvard needs to be planning for an entirely in-person and functionally back-to-normal semester in the fall! There is no reason why a university with the amount of resources that Harvard has couldn't make that happen. ",,,,,10,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,10,0,8,3,10,5,"I would like to see as little Covid-19 restrictions as possible, especially since most if not all Harvard students will be vaccinated by then. In any case, I would hope there wouldn't be any restrictions on movement, gathering, interaction, or usage of Harvard spaces. I understand if Harvard wouldn't want to organize any huge international conferences that brings high school students from all over the world, for example, but beyond that I see no reason for why any other restrictions should be in place. I would 100% make sure that Harvard focuses on vaccinating any students who come back to campus and haven't been vaccinated yet (and come up with a plan for them to vaccinate them before school starts, i.e make them arrive early to get the shot so that they can be more or less immune around when school starts or something like that), so that close to 100% of the Harvard population could be vaccinated by the time school starts and the Fall semester could be entirely normal. ","Maybe keeping Zoom office hours as an option since those are helpful for quick question. Also open-notes tests and exams. Otherwise, I would really like to see a return to pre-Covid Harvard as quickly as possible. ",Yes,Somewhat dissatisfied,"The fact that the entire social component of learning at Harvard is gone -¬†no friends, no dining hall conversations, no musical or athletic extracurriculars.

",Online learning is more challenging,,"Online learning is SO much more challenging! The toll it takes on your mental health, the lack of developing meaningful connections and friendships, and just the general burden of having to spend all day sitting in a chair and staring at a screen for over a year are all unbearable. Harvard has to return to a completely in-person semester in the Fall. ",Extremely dissatisfied,"It is literally impossible to meet new people (one of the most exciting parts of going to Harvard); and staying in touch with previous friends is very hard since regularly staying in touch is difficult, people are in different time zones, and Zoom calls cannot replace in person memories being made. There is absolutely no replacement (nothing even comes close) to regular, in-person living with your friends and that is the only way that Harvard can ensure that students have even a somewhat satisfactory social experience in the Fall. ","Although Harvard not returning to full pre-Covid campus in the Fall would be the greatest disappointment in the world (and frankly, would just be inexplicable) they should definitely prioritize making sure that all students can get back to campus and creating a situation where all students actually decide to live on campus (as opposed to on-campus). They can do as much testing as they want, but brining 95% of all four years back into the Harvard dorms in the fall is a MUST. ","If anyone from the Harvard administration ever reads this message: Please, please please ‚Äì¬†for the sake of the physical and mental health of all Harvard students, please do everything you can to have the Fall semester be as normal as possible and to have all Harvard students back in the dorms as it was before. Remote learning and being away from friends and campus has been so inexplicably detrimental to the physical, mental, emotional, and financial health of me and all of my friends. The only way to alleviate that is to make sure that all students return to campus in the Fall (or 95% of all students, essentially, pre-pandemic levels) so that students can continue their academic and social development and hopefully try to recuperate as much of the last lost year as possible.

And above all else, I and many other FGLI students had a tough time choosing between staying home and moving on campus since our funding grant for COVID was only given if we stayed off campus.

On top of this, many students have things to do besides doing schoolwork, such as taking time off for themselves to relax, destress, take care of themselves and their families, and spend time with their family members. However, despite the fact that remote students are living at home, because of the incredibly strenuous workload (considering that this is Harvard students doing the work) I feel students haven't been getting enough of this familial connection, let alone connections with friends. If my workload was a bit easier, and I could genuinely enjoy taking the classes I want without sacrificing my time and emotional well-being, I would rate the spring semester as a huge success.

People were having trouble finding friends because the only time we were able to see each other and interact was during zoom classes and even then, there was no time to socially interact. I think especially for international students this was burdensome because many are located in distant time zones and simply getting to some classes was hard, so taking time off to socially interact outside of classes was even harder.

Harvard has shown that they have the ability to rearrange class schedules within any given week, so Wellness Days should have always extended either a weekend or a federal holiday. The required shift in schedules by the college itself would have taken the pressure off of students to request that their professors be more mindful about assignments due near Wellness Days.

I am about 90% ready to choose a concentration in the fall - I am pretty sure I want to do applied math, but I'm not sure exactly what the area of application will be. I am also still interested in architecture, so that interest is probably why I'm not 100% set on applied math.

","At the beginning of the school year I was definitely scared that I wouldn't find friends to block with (especially since I have been at home both semesters), but it actually worked out pretty well. I don't think any changes need to be made for future first-year students if we completely re-open in the fall, since students will get to have the in-person, casual interactions that usually facilitate friendships (which then leads to people finding their blockmates).
